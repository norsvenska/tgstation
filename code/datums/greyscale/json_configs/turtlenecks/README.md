GREYSCALE TURTLENECKS
by norsvenska. credits at the bottom of the readme.
There's a bit of variety among turtlenecks in the game. Here's a brief rundown on each of the sprite parts in turtlenecks.dmi:
turtleneck and turtleneck_d (sleeves rolled up) are the standard, striped shirts that you see most of the time a turtleneck shows up ingame.
turtleneck_tactical and turtleneck_tactical_d (sleeves rolled up) are the nonstriped variants, previously seen as the tacticool turtlenecks, the ones you can purchase from a hacked autodrobe.
turtleneck_pants were ripped from the aforementioned tacticool turtleneck; they resemble basic pants.
turtleneck_pants_alt were ripped from the RD's turtleneck; they are a tad longer and more resemble jeans.
turtleneck_skirt was ripped from the tacticool turtleneck. self explanatory.
turtleneck_tacticalpants were ripped from the old tactical turtleneck. they have pockets, much like the paramedic's jumpsuit, for example.
turtleneck_tacticalpants_alt were ripped from the HoS's turtleneck. they are very similar to the latter sprite, but have darker shading and are slightly longer.
turtleneck_halfskirt_upper and turtleneck_halfskirt_lower are the two parts of the old HoS turtleneck skirt's skirt, which was half black and half red.
turtleneck_epaulettes were ripped from the HoS's turtleneck; they are small highlights on the shoulders.
turtleneck_cuffs were also ripped from the HoS's turtleneck; they are small highlights on the wrists.
turtleneck_belt and turtleneck_buckle were both ripped from the RD's turtleneck. together, they make a belt.
turtleneck_armbands were ripped from the old CE's turtleneck; they are small highlights on the upper arms.
padding is a blank sprite used to prevent issues when a worn sprite has more components than the item sprite. used on the hos's jumpsuit and the ce's jumpsuit for cuffs and armbands respectively.

_skirt variation is for, well, skirts.
_worn variation is needed because the shirts have alternate sprites (rolled up sleeves)

Note that none of the accessories are required for a complete sprite. If you choose to add them, make sure to layer them after the shirt and pants when making your config.

If any better config names arise, please add them. I don't like these names, but I'm unsure of what else to call them.

ORIGINAL SPRITE CREDITS:
The tactical turtleneck, tacticool turtleneck, both of which were used as primary bases for the sprites, were made by Imaginos16.
The research director's turtleneck was done by axietheaxolotl in 2022, with OrionTheFox having minorly touched up the sprites in 2023. Both are listed due to Orion's changes being minor.
The chief engineer's turtleneck was made by oldyezero.
The chief medical officer's turtleneck was designed by Imaginos16.
The head of security's turtleneck, which was also used as a base for many sprites, was done by axietheaxolotl and touched up by Twaticus.
The CentCom turtleneck was designed by Imaginos16.

That should be all the original sprite makers! Let me know if I missed anyone or erroneously added someone.
