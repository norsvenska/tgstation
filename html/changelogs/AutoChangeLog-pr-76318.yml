  - rscadd: "Coroners are now Morbid!"
  - rscadd: "Coroners come with a series of special tools that are especially good at performing certain surgeries if used by a Morbid individual (which the coroner happens to be). They are found in the coroner's medkit."
  - rscadd: "The sorts of surgeries they enjoy are; dissections, autospies, revival surgery, plastic surgery, organ/feature manipulations, amputations. Also eyesnatching."
  - rscadd: "Coroners therefore hate; tending the wounds of the living, defibrillation and CPR. Why waste so much effort on breathers if you can't even carve them up a bit first?"
  - rscadd: "Coroners love pickles and pickle juice."
  - rscadd: "The coroner can finally put their autopsy scanner into their special medkit. Not the compact one, though."
  - rscadd: "The elephant graveyard is safer to plunder for the morbid individual. The rewards from the graveyard are now also slightly more lucrative...if you don't care about being cursed, that is."
  - balance: "Roboticists get secure morgue access during skeleton shifts"
