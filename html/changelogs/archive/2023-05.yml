  EOBGames:
  - rscdel: Kilostation has went back to its home planet. It served us faithfully
      for nearly 3 and a half years. May it rest in peace.
  Helg2:

  san7890:
  - refactor: Spiderlings are now basic mobs, report any complete weirdness/deviation
      from known behavior. They should be a lot more intelligent now though.
  - rscadd: AI Spiderlings are super fragile, but they're also super fast, especially
      when they get into a vent. Once they're in circulation, they could end up everywhere!
      Maybe in the armory, maybe in a locked closet in maintenance. Be sure to be
      vigilant and splat them whenever you can to save the station from a whole lotta
      heartache!

  - server: Exporting player preferences is controlled by a configuration option,
      'FORBID_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'. If you do not wish to let clients access the ftp()
      function to their own preferences file (probably for bandwidth reasons?) you
      should uncomment this or add it to your config somehow.
  - config: Server operators are also able to set the cooldown between requests to
      download the JSON Preferences file via the 'SECONDS_COOLDOWN_FOR_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'
      config option.

      upon spawning
