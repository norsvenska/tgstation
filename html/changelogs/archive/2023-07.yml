  Cheshify, Kinnebian, and RedSentry27:
  - rscadd: Maintenance engineers have sent out blueprints across the sector for a
      new laser musket.
  - admin: A new energy-gun toting ERT is available to send to the crew.
  Jacquerel:
  - bugfix: Actions granted by equipped or held items now actually appear again
  LT3:
  - qol: Context tooltip size increased
  - bugfix: Fixed remnants of old maptext code on various things
  MTandi:
  - rscadd: Food and pills have a 10% chance to infect with one of three new diseases
      on consumption when left for more than 5 seconds on the floor. You can wash
      it to avoid disease. ChemMaster and Pill Press are added to the list of elevated
      structures (Considered as tables for pills). Made harvest spawn on top of hydrotrays
      to stay protected from germs.
  - rscadd: 'Added three new advanced diseases: Gastritium, Carpellosis, Nebula Nausea
      with static cures obtained by digesting dirty food.'
  - bugfix: Food no longer decomposes on Hydrotrays, Grilles, Bonfires and all dense
      kitchen machinery
  - code_imp: Decomposition now uses `germ_sensitive` component and follows 5 second
      rule too.
  - qol: Crafted food items spawns on nearby tables (except the one behind you) instead
      of dropping on floor when hands are full.
  SyncIt21:
  - bugfix: jetpack modules work on mod suits again
  - bugfix: jetpack cyber implants also work
  - refactor: removed `get_mover` callback, user is retrieved during activation
  - refactor: timestop module on `on_module_triggered()` accepts user as 2nd param
  Vekter:
  - balance: Increased armor penetration on xenos' neurotoxin spit. Well-protected
      crew members should still take more than a few hits to down but shouldn't be
      immune to it.
  necromanceranne:
  - rscadd: Coroners are now Morbid!
  - rscadd: Coroners come with a series of special tools that are especially good
      at performing certain surgeries if used by a Morbid individual (which the coroner
      happens to be). They are found in the coroner's medkit.
  - rscadd: The sorts of surgeries they enjoy are; dissections, autospies, revival
      surgery, plastic surgery, organ/feature manipulations, amputations. Also eyesnatching.
  - rscadd: Coroners therefore hate; tending the wounds of the living, defibrillation
      and CPR. Why waste so much effort on breathers if you can't even carve them
      up a bit first?
  - rscadd: Coroners love pickles and pickle juice.
  - rscadd: The coroner can finally put their autopsy scanner into their special medkit.
      Not the compact one, though.
  - rscadd: The elephant graveyard is safer to plunder for the morbid individual.
      The rewards from the graveyard are now also slightly more lucrative...if you
      don't care about being cursed, that is.
  - balance: Roboticists get secure morgue access during skeleton shifts
  timothymtorres:
  - qol: Add hotkeys to APCs for AIs and borgs. Toggle environmental (ctrl + shift),
      toggle lighting (shift), toggle equipment (alt), and toggle breaker (ctrl).
  - qol: Remove APC UI popup when using RMB to toggle the lock.
