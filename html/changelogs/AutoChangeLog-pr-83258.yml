  - balance: "buffed healing values of helbital, probital, lenturi, hercuri, syriniver, musiver, and tirimol for their respective damage types."
  - balance: "Tirimol now uses oxygen as a catalyst rather than consuming it over time making it easier to make without babysitting. Tirimol now requires much more careful management of impurity in order to make Super Melatonin."
