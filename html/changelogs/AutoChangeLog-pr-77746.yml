  - rscadd: "Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine treatment."
  - rscadd: "Drinking tea will help mend (non-bone) wounds over time."
  - rscadd: "Flour and corn starch may be splashed onto wounds to help dry them up, though they'll have a negative effect on burn wounds."
  - rscadd: "Added a new reagent, saltwater, made by combining table salt with water."
  - rscadd: "Table salt and saltwater can be splashed onto wounds as well, reducing bleeding and improving sanitization and disinfection significantly. However, the coarse undiluted salt will irritate the wounds, reducing clot rate and flesh healing, and both of the reagents will increase a burn wound's infestation rate."
  - rscadd: "Altered Table Salt's recipe to just need sodium and chloride. Changed the recipe of Pentetic Acid and Heparin to need table salt (sodium x chloride) and thus slightly altered the total output of those reagents (pentacid went from 5u per reaction to 4u, heparin 4u->3u)"
  - rscadd: "Saline-Glucose Solution now needs 2u of saltwater and 1u of sugar, meaning the overall recipe should be completely unchanged in practice. Contact me on discord if any issues arise from these chemical changes!"
  - qol: "First aid analyzers now give easy-to-understand direct information, with the specific recommended treatments bolded in the analysis text. They also have a 'unique' extra bit of info, telling you about improvised ways to remedy your wound."
