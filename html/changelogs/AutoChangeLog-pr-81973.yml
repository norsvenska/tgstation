changes:
  - refactor: "Touched most of the code for racks. It should function almost entirely the same save for what's noted here, please report any issues."
  - code_imp: "Wrenching moved to wrenching procs. Side-effect, rack items are only deconstructed on left-click"
  - sound: "Items that have sounds make them when placed on racks, much like when placed on tables."
  - sound: "Rack items now make a sound upon deconstructing them."
  - bugfix: "Racks no longer let you attempt to place abstract items like the slap hand or water tank spray nozzles on them."
  - qol: "Clicking on a rack no longer kicks the shit out of it if you don't actually have combat mode on."
  - qol: "Racks and rack items have hover tooltip usage context."
  - rscdel: "Killed ancient rack code for dragging your active item onto a rack. Just click it does the same thing. This allows you to actually dump items onto racks, though currently disorderly."
